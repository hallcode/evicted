            <h4>No or invalid notice given</h4>
            <p>
                It is a requirement that your landlord gives you notice in writing,
                using the proper forms.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your landlord has not given you any paperwork, or what they have given you
                is not on one of the proper government forms, then the eviction is not valid.
            </p>

            <h4>Not enough notice given</h4>
            <p>
                Eviction has been started under
                {{ checklist.get_notice_type()['rule'] }}
                {% if checklist.get_s8_ground() != None %}

                which requires a minimum of
                {{ checklist.get_notice_type()['required_notice']|notice_period }}
                notice. You have only been given
                {{ checklist.get_notice_length()|notice_period }}
                notice.
            </p>

        <li>
            <h4>Grounds are discretionary</h4>
            <p>
                The grounds used to evict you ({{ checklist.get_s8_grounds()['name'] }} are
                discretionary. This means that not only does the landlord have to prove that
                the grounds apply to your situation, they also have to persuade the judge that
                it's reasonable to evict you in this case.
