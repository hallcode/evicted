This service is free and provided as-is with no 
guarantee or warranty. **You must also get proper legal
advice to help with your eviction,** but you can use this as a starting point for
learning your rights as a tenant.

### There will be a lot of questions
We will ask you quite a lot of questions about
your situation. This is because to check that 
the eviction is valid, we need a lot of detail.

### Data protection
We store your data as a file on our server. 
These files are deleted after 30 days, but
you can click a link on the results page to delete
them early.

We don't ask for your name or any other identifiable information
and we don't share these files with anyone else.
They will be used only to provide you with this
service.
