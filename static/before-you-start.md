This checklist is designed with the most common situations in mind, 
however if you have a complicated or unusual situation then the answers

If any of the following apply, the results may not be reliable:

* You have an agricultural tenancy
* Your house is provided as part of your job
* You are in temporary accommodation provided by a local authority
* You have an Assured Shorthold tenancy with a housing association

In any case, you should always seek proper legal advice in addition to
completing this checklist.
